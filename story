    Once upon a time a fat man went to the gym with his friend.
    They both ran 5km every day to get skinnier.
    Their running path took them into the forest which was the lair of a huge, hungry wolf.
    The other people in the city were scared of the wolf and the fat man was warned not to go in the forest.
    But, the fat man dedicated on losing weight didnt listen, nor did his friend.
    One day, as they were running into the forest they heard a long and eerie howl.
